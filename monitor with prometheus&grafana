What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open source monitoring tool
Provides out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities for the Kubernetes container orchestration platform. It can monitor servers and databases as well.
Collects and stores metrics as time-series data, recording information with a timestamp 
It is based on pull and collects metrics from targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.

What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open source visualization and analytics software. 
It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics no matter where they are stored.


Key components:-

    1. Prometheus server - Processes and stores metrics data
    2. Alert Manager - Sends alerts to any systems/channels
    3. Grafana - Visualize scraped data in UI


Implementation steps:-

We need to add the Helm Stable Charts for your local client. Execute the below command:
$ helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
# Add prometheus Helm repo
$ helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm search repo prometheus-community
$ kubectl create namespace prometheus
$ helm install stable prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n prometheus
$ kubectl get pods -n prometheus
$ kubectl get svc -n prometheus
## change cluster ip to nodeport
$ kubectl edit svc stable-kube-prometheus-sta-prometheus -n prometheus
Edit Grafana Service:-

$ kubectl edit svc stable-grafana -n prometheus
